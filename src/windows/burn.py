# Windows - Burning Kano OS module
#
# The writing (burning) process uses a 7zip to dd pipe to eliminate the
# need for uncompressing the image and extra space needed.
#
# As opposed to OSX and Linux versions of dd, here do not need a polling loop.
# However, dd does not report its writing speed, so we time it ourselves.
#
# We will also notify the UI of any errors that might have occured.
